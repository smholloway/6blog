 - I saw this video last year, but I love to revisit the ideas: [Bret Victor's talk "Inventing on Pricinple"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII). Watch that, then go read his post about [moving up and down the ladder of abstraction](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/) or his [critique of Khan Academy](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/). I have high hopes for BV's ideas and their ability to transform software development.
 - [How to Lie With Statistics by Darrell Huff](http://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728). This book is a bit dated, but the information is still relevant!
 - [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/), which Derek Sivers mentioned as [a way to efficiently learn a new programming language](http://sivers.org/srs).
