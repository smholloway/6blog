 - I saw this video last year, but I love to revisit the ideas: [Bret Victor's talk "Inventing on Pricinple"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII). Watch that, then go read his post about [moving up and down the ladder of abstraction](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/) or his [critique of Khan Academy](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/). I have high hopes for BV's ideas and their ability to transform software development. (Nick's note: Also check out Bret Victor's paper, [Magic Ink](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/).)
 - [How to Lie With Statistics by Darrell Huff](http://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728). This book is a bit dated, but the information is still relevant!
 - [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/), which Derek Sivers mentioned as [a way to efficiently learn a new programming language](http://sivers.org/srs). Basically, learning theory says to review ideas after 1, 10, 30, and 60 days. From there, the information should be set. Anki is a system that repeats specified information at these meaningful intervals. 

### Nick
 - [Swagger](http://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/). From the home page, "The Swagger framework simultaneously solves server, client, and documentation/sandbox needs." This sounds like a tall order, and it is, but it's definitely an issue that needs to be addressed. Two things that I like about Swagger: the API specification is generated from code and the UI looks really slick. I can't stress enough how awesome it is to have the API spec be derived from the code instead of only the other way around. Too many developer hours have been wasted keeping the specification and implementation in sync--causing most developers to renounce specifications all together.  On the latter point, I love a fantasistic user experience and beautiful display--it just makes everything better. Seth and I wrote our own swagger-like interface for an API demo a few months back. It would have been nice to use swagger instead.
 - [Scalatra](http://www.scalatra.org/). Scalatra is great! It is a Scala port of [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/), a Ruby web micro-framework. Scalantra gives me hope that the JVM world could be like the Ruby world. In fact, I first heard about Scalatra from the [Ruby Rogues podcast on service oriented design](http://rubyrogues.com/076-rr-service-oriented-design-with-paul-dix/) with [Paul Dix](http://www.pauldix.net/). I think you'll start to see a lot of developers reach for Scalatra when performance becomes an issue--which, lets face it, is pretty much right away for any real project.
