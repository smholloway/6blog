### Seth
 - I saw this video last year, but I love to revisit the ideas: [Bret Victor's talk "Inventing on Pricinple"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII). Watch that, then go read his post about [moving up and down the ladder of abstraction](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/) or his [critique of Khan Academy](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/). I have high hopes for BV's ideas and their ability to transform software development.
 - [How to Lie With Statistics by Darrell Huff](http://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728). This book is a bit dated, but the information is still relevant!
 - [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/), which Derek Sivers mentioned as [a way to efficiently learn a new programming language](http://sivers.org/srs).

### Nick
 - [Swagger](http://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/) From the home page, "The Swagger framework simultaneously solves server, client, and documentation/sandbox needs." This sounds like a tall order, and it is, but its definitely an issue that needs to be addressed. Two things that I like about Swagger: the API specification is generated from code and the UI looks really slick. I can't stress enough how awesome it is to have the API spec be derived from the code instead of only the other way around. Too many developer hours have been wasted keeping the specification and implementation in sync-- causing most developers to renounce specifications all together.  If you know me, you know I love a fantasistic user experience and beautiful display. Seth and I wrote our own swagger-like interface for an API demo a few months back. It would have been nice to use swagger instead.
 - [Scalatra](http://www.scalatra.org/) -- Scalatra is great because it gives me hope that a community in the JVM world could be like a community from the the Ruby world. In fact, I first heard about Scalatra from the [Ruby Rogues Podcast](http://rubyrogues.com/076-rr-service-oriented-design-with-paul-dix/) with [Paul Dix](http://www.pauldix.net/) on service oriented design. I think you'll start to see a lot of developers who like the simplicity of a web micro-framework reach for Scalatra when performance starts to be an issue-- which, lets face it, is pretty much right away for anything other than a toy project.
