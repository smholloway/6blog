### Seth
 - [Engineering Elegance on InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Square). Square's CTO, [Bob Lee](http://blog.crazybob.org/), talks about the lessons learned in his years at great technical companies like Google and Square. The talk is Java-centric, but I won't hold that against Crazy Bob ;-)
 - [A Tour of Go](http://tour.golang.org/). I love online tutorials! The ability to experiment with a language in the browser is incredible and the Go Tour is one of the best out there. [Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)) is a system programming language from Google. The language has some really neat features, so check out the tour.
 - [Excerpt from The Technical and Social History of Software Engineering](http://www.itmpi.org/Portals/10/PDF/Capers-2019.pdf). The new Capers Jones book looks interesting, but too academic for mass consumption. In this excerpt, Capers lays out 12 problems that he believes can be fixed by 2020. I like several of the points, particularly "12. Maintenance, enhancements, and renovation of legacy applications need more research."
