  - [Eric Whitacre - TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/eric_whitacre_a_virtual_choir_2_000_voices_strong.html). This video is fantastic! Conductor Eric Whitacre created a virtual choir with over 2,000 people. It shows how transformative the Internet is and the lengths that people will go to to connect with like-minded individuals.
