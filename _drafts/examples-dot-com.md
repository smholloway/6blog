Have you ever been frustrated while looking for an example of some software process? The Internet is full of examples, but they're spread across tens of sites like StackOverflow, GitHub, and countless personal blogs.

Examples.com is a vision we have for providing high-quality, fresh examples.

Hubot is easy to download and use, but the documentation lacks an end-to-end example.

The time is right for a site that provides real world examples of software concepts using open source projects. For example, do you know a project that demonstrates a layered architecture? What about a polyglot system? It would be great to get out of toy examples and see real codebases that apply the best practices we read about.
