### Seth
 - [Jon Purdy's Introduction to Concatenative Languages](http://evincarofautumn.blogspot.mx/2012/02/why-concatenative-programming-matters.html). My [language exploration](http://sethholloway.com/blog/2012/05/08/my-experience-with-programming-languages/) has taken me many places, but I have very little familiarity with stack-based langauges. This article has a lot of information and is worth checking out if you're interested in programming languages.
 - [The 4 Hour Workweek](). I was skeptical about this book after hearing some negative reviews, but I gave it a shot. The book made me think a lot about work, life, and money. Ferris pushes the idea of happiness through efficiency; for example, if you can complete a task in one hour instead of eight hours, do it in one and let something else take up your time. Obvious, right? The examples are thorough and, if you're open to the ideas, you can figure out ways to eek out more productivity.
