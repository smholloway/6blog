title: Technology Predictions for 2013

I think there are a ton of directions for tech! 

There are more mobile devices than ever and I see a continued proliferation of supporting hardware and software. 
The web will kick ass, but won't chip away at native app growth. 
Chrome will move even further ahead in the browser wars. Look for emscripten and Google's PNaCl to gain new followers. 
I think LightTable IDE will make a splash, but not provide enough features to make it into the enterprise. Online education will be hot. 
New donation platforms like Snoball and Crowdrise will make charitable giving easier, and social platforms will help make it cool. 
Functional programming and concurrency will continue to garner attention, as will domain specific languages and data analysis. 
As hardware hits physical limits, we'll see more interest in improving software; I also predict that Apple's idea of using CPU and GPU (grand central dispatch) will be more widespread.
