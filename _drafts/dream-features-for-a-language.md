As developers, we spend the majority of our waking hours interacting
with a programming language. As such, it would be nice to love the
language we are using.

  - REPL
  - Package management
  - Namespaces
  - Named parameters
  - Default parameters
  - Closures
  - Performance, which generally necessitates providing more information
    to the compiler; e.g., type information
