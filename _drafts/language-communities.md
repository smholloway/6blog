Programming language communities vary.

## Java
Java is a popular choice in the enterprise space. It is established and vast--there are tons of frameworks and libraries. Java programmers are employed for everything from desktop apps to web apps to mobile apps; chances are, if there's a domain, someone is solving that domain's problems with Java.

Java is a language of legacy. There are billions of lines of Java running worldwide and thousands of programmers maintaining those legacy applications.

I do not encounter many people (as an absolute) that are truly excited about Java, and because there are so many Java programmers the percentage of people that are excited about Java is very low.

## JavaScript
JavaScript is the world's most pervasive programming language--virtually every computer from phone to table to desktop has a browser with JavaScript. Since the web began, JavaScript has been used to enhance websites. In the past few years JavaScript was legitimized by large programs that operate outside the browser, like MongoDB and Node.js.

The JavaScript community is full of activity as people create (and recreate) tools and frameworks. An established language, like Java, already has a huge variety of language add-ons. As JavaScript innovation slows and "the right way" becomes clear, we will see people move to a new platform that offers excitement and prestige.

Programmers, like all humans, want respect, adoration, and excitement. New languages offer excitement and the chance to do something new and important, which attracts a lot of people.
