Java is a follower more often than it is a leader.

A few examples:
  - Node.js -> Vert.x
  - Ruby on Rails -> [Java on Trails](http://trails.codehaus.org/)
  - Actors -> Akka

What is Java good at?
  - Hadoop and the whole MapReduce paradigm
  - Performance
  - Statically typed for easy debugging
  - Widespread
  - Bob Lee

I think there's a reason that people are doing amazing things in other languages. In my opinion, Java should attract the kind of people who will innovate.

Improve documentation
Focus on aesthetics
Focus on what you're good at (see above)
Innovate, don't imitate
