### Seth
 - [Downcast](http://www.downcastapp.com/). Downcast is an awesome iOS podcast app.
 - [Software Engineering Radio podcast](http://www.se-radio.net/). This is one of my favorite podcast series! They land some great guests and lead the conversation nicely--they're experienced and well read, but they keep newbies in mind as they define terms early and often.
