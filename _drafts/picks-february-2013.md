 - [Downcast](http://www.downcastapp.com/). Downcast is an awesome iOS podcast app. It costs a couple bucks, but is worth it. One of my favorite features is the 2x playback speed.
 - [Software Engineering Radio podcast](http://www.se-radio.net/). This is one of my favorite podcast series! They land some great guests and lead the conversation nicely--they're experienced and well read, but they keep newbies in mind as they define terms early and often. The sound quality varies and the hosts have European accents, so I have to back off the 2x playback speed--1x and 1.5x are comprehensible for me.

### Nick
 - [Light table](http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/04/12/light-table---a-new-ide-concept/). Light table is a concept IDE devloped by Chris Granger and team. They cite [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/) as an influence for the project. I downloaded the playground and played with it a bit. Looks pretty slick! +1 for running in the browser.
 - [Cloud9](https://c9.io/). Cloud9 is a broswer-based IDE for developing code in the cloud. I've wanted something like this for a long time and it definitely seems like we'll all be developing this way in the future. I ran into some trouble getting it to work on c9.io and locally but I'm still excited about it. If I get some time to work on an open source project, this one is at the top of my list. +1 for running in the browser and +10 for vim bindings.
