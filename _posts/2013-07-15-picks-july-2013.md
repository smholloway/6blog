### Seth
 - [BlackHat](http://www.blackhat.com/us-13/) and [DEFCON](https://www.defcon.org/). [Toopher](https://www.toopher.com/) sent me to (some of) Black Hat and DEFCON, and it was awesome! If you're into security, check it out. DEFCON was only $180 cash, making it one of the least expensive conferences you could attend.
