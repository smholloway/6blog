## Overall

It was an entertaining read. Ramit is funny and provides many valuable insights and references. If you already have a good income haven’t read many personal finance books, give this one a try.

## Takeaways

* The most important step is the first one. Just get started! It gets easier as you go.
* You don’t have to be a financial expert to manage your finances.
* Ask yourself why do you want to be rich and what does rich mean to you because being rich is not just about money.
* Automation is the key. If your finances take a lot of work, you’re less likely to do it
* Multiple sources of credit matter
* 6 commandments of credit cards
Pay off your credit card regularly
Get fees waived on your card
Negotiate lower APR
Keep your cards for a long time and keep them active
Get more credit (Only if you have no debt)
Use your rewards
* If you do get fees, call and be assertive , half the time they'll drop them 
* Credit cards offer extended warranties, trip cancellation protection, and consumer protection
* 5 steps to get rid of your debt 
Find out how much debt you have
Decide what you should pay off first
Negotiate a lower APR
Decide where the money to pay your debt will come from
Start making a dent
* online accounts offer higher rates. Not sure if this is still true, risk free interest rates are at about 1%
* 5 shiny tactics banks use to trick you
Teaser rates
 Requiring minimum balances
Upsells
Holding out on premium accounts
Bundling a credit card
* Ask for things and don't take the first no 
* I like the approach of automatically take out savings and then spend guilt free. I think this works a lot better than spend all month under a microscope and then take out your savings
* Consider switching from subscription services to a-la-cart purchases for things like TV shows and movies
* Make small sustainable changes instead of drastic one time changes. I’ve seen a lot of people make the mistake of reading a personal finance book and changing their whole life around only to fall back to their old ways
* 30 day challenge to save $1,000. http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/challenges/save-1000/
* He recommends the use of David Swensons portfolio allocation
* People try to save on minutia but fail to save on large purchases like cars
* Negotiating salary is best time to increase your income 
* Think about total cost of ownership 
* Indirectly his core message is to think about your finances proactively 

## Pros
* Reading the book help me think about the big picture and all of my money net of fees 
* Ramit provides a step by step 6 week program to get your finances on track. I like the concrete approach and believe it provides value
* I like that he went into depth on some of the topics like credit cards. And that he gives very specific phone call instructions rather than, “Call the company”
* I really like the psychological trick approach rather than the white knuckle approach. It’s better to set yourself up for success than to rely on pure will power to do things you don’t really want to do.

## Cons
* He uses average annual return of 8% which can be misleading. If you started investing in 2000, you probably don’t have 15 years of compounding at 8% in your bank account.
* Over estimated the effectiveness of having a plan to saying no to things 
* In the section on portfolio allocation, he mentions the conventional wisdom that bonds are used to offset stocks in periods where stocks are declining like 2008. But he didn't realize that bonds also dropped in 2008. As a trader this sets off alarms for me and made it apparent that he was recycling conventional wisdom rather than providing new insights. 
* Ramit doesn’t teach you how to become rich, just how to manage your money when you get it. it's mainly for people who have money and income.

# Seth

This book provides the basics of personal finance. In it, Ramit proposes a very practical 85% solution that will set you on the path to financial independence in just six weeks. Start now.

## Takeaways 

* Diet and finance are a lot alike: both realms are ruled by blowhards with wildly differing opinions who all prey on your innate desires. Everyone wants to be fit and wealthy--and that’s really pretty simple--but pundits make it sounds hard. I really liked this analogy.
* Credit makes a big difference in the long term, so maximize your credit score. The largest purchases we make are on credit and a better credit score can save you thousands per large purchase. Unfortunately, the formula for scoring credit is owned by one company and they don’t share it. From what is known, 35% of your credit score is based your payment history, so never miss a payment; 30% is based on how much credit you use vs what you have (“credit utilization”), so increase your credit limits.
* Negotiate for zero fees and to get fees removed. See the book or website for scripts outlining what to say. 
* Ladder of Personal Finance:
    1. Contribute to 401k up to company match.
    2. Eliminate credit card debt.
    3. Max your Roth IRA.
    4. If you have more money, top off your 401k.
    5. Last, open an investment account or invest in a side business.
* Pre-tax dollars are important because you can invest 25% (or your tax percentage) more than with post-tax dollars. The 401k is a good deal! You can roll it into an IRA.
* A Roth IRA uses post-tax dollars but has zero tax later. You can pull out the principal along the way, so it's not so scary.
* Ramit’s “Conscious Spending Plan” is a great idea. The gist is to divide your take-home pay into four buckets: **50-60%** - fixed costs and essentials (rent, utilities, etc); **10%** - long-term investments (your retirement fund); **5-10%** - short-term savings goals (TV, car, down payment for a home, etc); **20-35%** - guilt-free spending (entertainment, eating out, shopping, etc). If you can hit these numbers, you will be rich.
* Home ownership is more expensive than it seems on the surface. Beyond rent you have upkeep inside and out, renovations, repairs, taxes, insurance, and the responsibility that comes with owning a home.

## Pros

* Great advice, clearly stated. The step-by-step plans were really helpful and they were presented in easily digested chunks.
* The book felt genuine and helpful. There was no sales pitch nor affiliate links.
* Helpful scripts for how to negotiate with customer service.

## Cons

* One size doesn't fit all. The author clearly states that the book is an 85% solution, so this isn’t a con as much as a disclaimer that you will not find tricks of the rich or magical insights beyond the fact that you need to start.
* If you've been educated in personal finance you may not find much novelty here.
* The book is less professional than the average finance book; for example, the author references Indians’ frugality and habitual haggling. I thought it was endearing, but I could imagine an ultra PC person being upset by the style.

## Who Should Read This Book

* People lacking knowledge of personal finance.
* Anyone who does not already have a checking account, savings account, and 401k or IRA.
* Anyone who has credit card debt.
