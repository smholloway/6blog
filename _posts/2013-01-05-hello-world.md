Hello, world! 

This is our first post. We started the blog as a way to document our frequent technical conversations. We think big and try to be the best we can be.

 - What are the important problems in software?
 - How can you quantify code quality?
 - What problems can tools solve?
 - How do you motivate people to be better?
 - Who are the best programmers?
 - What does it mean to be a good programmer?
 - Why are some people more productive than others?
 - What roles does a project need to succeed?
 - How far can you go without a manager or product manager?
 - When should I use X framework? What are the pros, cons, and use cases?

Look for our thoughts on these questions and more!
