### Seth
 - [Toopher](https://www.toopher.com/). I started at Toopher this month, and I love it! The technology is neat, the people are great, and the product helps the world. So, what is it? Toopher is two factor authentication of the future! No more messing with dongles or typing in a funny string of numbers that changes while you're trying to enter it. By using your phone's location, users receive all the added security of 2FA without the usual hassles. I look forward to my favorite sites adding usable security with Toopher :)
