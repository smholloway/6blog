## Takeaways
* I can focus the lens of objectivity on others but I struggle being objective about myself.  Something clicked with me when he talked about how it is often easier to be objective about someone else’s life. It’s immediately obvious to me when someone else is moving in the wrong direction, but it’s much harder to look at myself that way. A great hack is to project your situation on to someone else and make the decision for them.
* The book suggests “doing everything your best.” But I don’t do my best in all situations--I do my best when I’m passionate about something. When I worked retail, I did a mediocre job but this post has consumed hours. Does anyone do their best all the time?
* Principles for a good life: How about something like this: "work hard, be honest, and help others"
* Constraints are a good thing! This is a common thread amongst many great thinkers and it makes a ton of sense. There are way too many possibilities, so having constraints makes us focus and pick one path.
* I really like the Boy Scout motto of preparing for tough times instead of hoping for good times. I think most people hope that good things happen, and are devastated when things go “bad”. To be resilient we need to prepare for hard times.
* Another common thread amongst many thinkers is to realize there are things you cannot control and focus only on the things you can control.
* Another thing I struggle with is seeing “bad” things as opportunities and appreciating them for what they are.
* Another common idea amongst teachers is to think about your own mortality. When I first contemplated my mortality I felt fear and sorrow. It’s a powerful way to focus, but I think most people avoid it because it is scary and saddening. I think most successful people use this technique to push themselves to greatness. A trick that I use is to think about the line, “Valar morghulis,” from Game of Thrones, which means “All men must die.” For me, this is a more palatable way to begin with the end in mind.
* Life will always present more obstacles. I thought that being successful would lead me to the promised land where life is obstacle-free. But I don’t think that belief serves me well. I want to adopt a hunger for obstacles instead so I can get better at crushing them.

## Pros
* It made me feel hopeful and inspired.
* Hearing the words of stoicism made me want to be a better person
* I liked that the chapters were short and digestible.

## Cons
* I felt some of the arguments were ambiguous but made to sound exact. This is a common complaint I have about books. For instance, the persistent use of the word “right,” which is ambiguous but can be said in a way that makes it feel exact. After preaching what not to do he said, “Might as well do life right.”  It's hard to argue that we should do life right, but what is right? I’d like to see more clarification. 
* A lot of the stories were retrofitted to his arguments--attributing things in a vacuum; for example, it is impossible to say that the inside of the iPhone is beautiful because Steve Jobs cared about craft. There are too many variables to say that definitively, but it makes for a great story. Who knows if Jobs had anything to do with it? It could have been the engineers or other designers. People like Steve Jobs have greatness attributed to them when it took way more than one person.

# Seth
Overall, this was a worthwhile read. I’d summarize the content by saying that you should make the most of any situation. (Perhaps the book’s value comes is in defining this good attitude and showing how several successful people apply the principle.)
## Takeaways
* Ryan Holiday is an impressive person; he’s written three well reviewed books by age 26. He seems to have the formula down.
* Hundreds of people have independently discovered a similar philosophy of accepting the things you cannot change; for example, Stoics, Buddhists, Alcoholics Anonymous, and victims of oppression.
* Stay calm. Control your psychology. Right action follows right thinking. This was very powerful for me to read and internalize.
* There is something positive about every negative situation and every failure offers a chance to learn. This is something that I was more keenly aware of earlier in life, so it was nice to have a reminder to help me get back on track.
* This book gelled nicely with other things I’m reading and my own insights. I’ve recently seen the idea of being present and collecting yourself mentioned by Tony Robbins, Gerald Weinberg, James Altucher, Eckhart Tolle, and others.
* I think the Stoics should be taught in school. As the book says, we’re not taught how to fail.
* I would have liked to see more concrete advice about how to go from one situation to another.
* Hero-worship stories from Cultists of Done never explain how people do the impossible. One story says that Steve Jobs fired an engineer who believed a goal could not be reached while another engineer said it could--what was the difference between the solutions in mind for both engineers? The only do-the-impossible situations I’ve experienced involved dramatic restatements of the problem and huge quality compromises. Did Jobs get a second-rate product from a confident psychopath? I’d really like a book about how modern engineers achieve things that others can’t.

## Pros
* A nice summary of Stoic philosophy with proper attributions.
* A palatable reminder to make the most of your situation.
* Short and meaningful.
* Ample entertaining anecdotes from various places and times.

## Cons
* The book could be tighter by removing some of the opening motivation and some repetition. For some people, the repetition may strengthen the message but I found myself saying, “Okay, I get it.”
* I found a few of the lessons to be contradictory. Some of the people in the examples are praised for action and some for inaction. For example, the overwhelming German Blitzkrieg attack worked for a long time before it failed, and the book points out the failure instead of the success; later, a general splits his forces and wins the battle in an extremely risky maneuver--here, the over-commitment is held up as the right decision while it was the wrong move for Germans (after it failed). In another example, Rockefeller is praised for not investing money early in his career; however, I felt other stories pushed hard for action. One anecdote about Steve Jobs said he was uncompromising and refused to take no for an answer when developing a mouse while a different Jobs anecdote shows him compromising (where he is a pragmatic craftsman). Lincoln is praised for his emotion while Rockefeller is praised for his complete lack thereof. Amelia Earhart’s right move was to take an insulting job as the token woman but Rubin “Hurricane” Carter’s Stoic move involved refusing to let anyone put him down. The lesson I took away was, “history is written by the victor” rather than, “stoicism prevails.”
