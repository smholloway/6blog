## Takeaways
* Something that I know I struggle with is being objective about myself. Something clicked with me when he talked about how it is often easier to be objective about someone else’s life. It’s immediately obvious when they is doing something that will not lead them in the direction they want to be going, but it’s much harder to look at myself that way. A great hacks for is to see yourself as if you were looking at someone else.
* Common thread of many people who talk about getting things done but I don’t think it could ever be overrated. A way to make meaningful action is to 
* I struggle A LOT with the idea of “doing everything your best”, it’s a common thread across many historical philosophies but I have a really hard time not seeing things as beneath me and working hard to be perfect. Even for things that are not beneath me, if it’s not something I’m directly or doing I have a hard time giving it my all. We all have limited focus and time so if I’m putting 100% of my focus and energy into something that may not have a big impact then it could be a waste. I can’t tell if I should heed this advice and use it as an opportunity to build character or continue on my current path. This book definitely makes me second guess my current way.
* Principles for a good life: each thing should be done with hard work, honesty, and helping others as best we can.
* Constraints are a good thing! This is a common thread amongst many great thinkers and it makes a ton of sense. There are way too many possibilities, so having constraints is the only way to have a path.
* I really like the Boy Scout motto of preparing for tough times instead of hoping for good times. I think most people hope that good things happen, and are devastated when things go “bad”. To be resilient we need to prepare for hard times.
* Another common thread amongst many thinkers including Seven habits is to distinguish between things you can control and can’t control and focus on the things you can control.
* Another thing I struggle with is seeing “bad” things as opportunities and loving/appreciating them because of that. I love the idea of “loving” things becomes fuel for you
* Another common idea amongst teachers and 7 Habits like is to think about your own mortality. In 7 habits its, begin with the end in mind. At first, this always feels really scary and morbid to think about but I can’t say enough about how helpful it is to think about to put things in perspective. To get over the fear/morbidity instead of thinking about death, I think about the line from Game of Thrones, “Valar morghulis” which means “All men must die”. It’s a somewhat indirect way to get me to begin with the end in mind.
* There is no getting past obstacles to a place with no obstacles. I don’t know why but for some reason I want things to be easy. I want to be successful or wealthy because I beleive that will make things easier. But I don’t think that belief serves me at all. I think believing that getting past obstacles to success or wealth leads to a place with more obstacles and maybe larger obstacles. And so what I should believe and even desire is more obstacles in my life so I can become great at facing them.

## Pros
* It had what I need from a book: it made me feel hopeful and inspired.
* Hearing the words of stoicism made me want to learn more to be a better person
* I liked that the chapters were short and digestible 

## Cons
* This is a common thing that I don’t like in many books but I felt like the language and arguments are ambiguous but made to sound exact. For instance, the relatively persistent use of the word “right”. I’m not sure if that is Ryan’s term or if it came from the stoicism examples he’s conveying but obviously the word “right” is ambiguous but can be said in a way that makes it feel exact. After talking a lot about what not to do he said, “Might as well do life right.” I’d like to see more definition and clarification around what he means by “right.”
* A similar one is “works”. Similar to “right” “works” is ambiguous at best. Also, “any way that works” can be a slippery slope. Really horrible things “worked” for someone in a given situation.
* I think a lot of authors do this but he keeps saying, in this situation do this, but in this other situation don’t do that, do this other thing. It’s really hard to know what to do when you’re in the situation and really easy to say what you should have done in retrospect. 
* And it felt like he did a similar thing where he back fit stories to fit the perspective. Attributing things I don’t think are possible to attribute, like Steve Jobs with the inside of the iPhone because Jobs cared about craft. Who knows if Jobs had anything to do with it? It could have been the engineers or other designers. It may be a known fact that Jobs is responsible for this but people like Steve Jobs get the actions retrofitted to their purported character and I think it’s ambiguous at best.

# Seth
Overall, this was a worthwhile read. I’d summarize the content by saying that you should make the most of any situation. (Perhaps the book’s value comes is in defining this good attitude and showing how several successful people apply the principle.)

## Takeaways
* Ryan Holiday is an impressive person; he’s written three well reviewed books by age 26. He seems to have the formula down.
* Hundreds of people have independently discovered a similar philosophy of accepting the things you cannot change; for example, Stoics, Buddhists, Alcoholics Anonymous, and victims of oppression.
* Stay calm. Control your psychology. Right action follows right thinking. This was very powerful for me to read and internalize.
* There is something positive about every negative situation and every failure offers a chance to learn. This is something that I was more keenly aware of earlier in life, so it was nice to have a reminder to help me get back on track.
* This book gelled nicely with other things I’m reading and my own insights. I’ve recently seen the idea of being present and collecting yourself mentioned by Tony Robbins, Gerald Weinberg, James Altucher, Eckhart Tolle, and others.
* I think the Stoics should be taught in school. As the book says, we’re not taught how to fail. 
* I would have liked to see more concrete advice about how to go from one situation to another.
* Hero-worship stories from Cultists of Done never explain how people do the impossible. One story says that Steve Jobs fired an engineer who believed a goal could not be reached while another engineer said it could--what was the difference between the solutions in mind for both engineers? The only do-the-impossible situations I’ve experienced involved dramatic restatements of the problem and huge quality compromises. Did Jobs get a second-rate product from a confident psychopath? I’d really like a book about how modern engineers achieve things that others can’t.

## Pros
* A nice summary of Stoic philosophy with proper attributions.
* A palatable reminder to make the most of your situation.
* Short and meaningful.
* Ample entertaining anecdotes from various places and times.

## Cons
* The book could be tighter by removing some of the opening motivation and some repetition. For some people, the repetition may strengthen the message but I found myself saying, “Okay, I get it.”
* I found a few of the lessons to be contradictory. Some of the people in the examples are praised for action and some for inaction. For example, the overwhelming German Blitzkrieg attack worked for a long time before it failed, and the book points out the failure instead of the success; later, a general splits his forces and wins the battle in an extremely risky maneuver--here, the over-commitment is held up as the right decision while it was the wrong move for Germans (after it failed). In another example, Rockefeller is praised for not investing money early in his career; however, I felt other stories pushed hard for action. One anecdote about Steve Jobs said he was uncompromising and refused to take no for an answer when developing a mouse while a different Jobs anecdote shows him compromising (where he is a pragmatic craftsman). Lincoln is praised for his emotion while Rockefeller is praised for his complete lack thereof. Amelia Earhart’s right move was to take an insulting job as the token woman but Rubin “Hurricane” Carter’s Stoic move involved refusing to let anyone put him down. The lesson I took away was, “history is written by the victor” rather than, “stoicism prevails.”
