### Seth
 - [Engineering Elegance on InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Square). Square's CTO, [Bob Lee](http://blog.crazybob.org/), talks about the lessons learned in his years at great technical companies like Google and Square. The talk is Java-centric, but I won't hold that against Crazy Bob ;-)
 - [A Tour of Go](http://tour.golang.org/). I love online tutorials! The ability to experiment with a language in the browser is incredible and the Go Tour is one of the best out there. [Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)) is a system programming language from Google. The language has some really neat features, so check out the tour.
 - [Excerpt from The Technical and Social History of Software Engineering](http://www.itmpi.org/Portals/10/PDF/Capers-2019.pdf). The new Capers Jones book looks interesting, but too academic for mass consumption. In this excerpt, Capers lays out 12 problems that he believes can be fixed by 2020. I appreciate several of the points, particularly "12. Maintenance, enhancements, and renovation of legacy applications need more research." Despite their prevalence in the real world, very few of the software talks/blogs/books I've consumed have addressed legacy systems.

### Nick
I'm picking people this month!
- [Nathn Marz](http://nathanmarz.com/) has been doing really great work in the Big Data space. He created [Storm](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm), a real time Big Data solution, and opened sourced it in the middle of [this talk](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Storm), which is awesome. He wrote a [book](http://www.manning.com/marz/) on what he's calling the 'Lambda Architecture' for Big Data. Check out his work!
- [Pieter Hintjens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Hintjens) is the creator of [0MQ](http://www.zeromq.org/) and the original author of the [AMQP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol) standard. Check out his [talk](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Architecture-Scale-ZeroMQ) where he is like a valcano of wisdom spewing insight, including "Simplicity always beats functionality," "The physics of software is the physics of people," "Do nothing that is not a mininal, plausible answer to a well defined problem," and "Design by removing problems, not adding features."
