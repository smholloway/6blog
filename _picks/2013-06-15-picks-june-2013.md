### Seth
 - [Leadership and Self-Deception](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1576759776/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1576759776&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20). This book had great bang for the buck: it was a quick read full of interesting ideas. Basically, you judge people harshly when you fail to do something you should have done. You betray yourself and get upset. Once you're upset, you have to justify that feeling so you make the person out to be worse than they are. You have to break the cycle and give people the benefit of the doubt. I hope I can implement some of the lessons and be a better person.
 - [The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691156662/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0691156662&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20). Another book that was well worth reading. I think this should be required reading in schools across the world. You must think deeply and critically; ensure you truly understand concepts, then explore further. One of my favorite pieces of advice was to add an adjective where one does not exist. For example, "my *first* blog" means something different than "my blog." By simply opening the door to the possibility that there might be a second (or third or forth or ...) blog, you find new possibilities. Some others: "the *black* TV," "our *desktop* computer," etc. Check this one out if you're interesting in thinking more effectively--and you should be :)
