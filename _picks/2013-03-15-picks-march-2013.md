 - [Eric Whitacre - A Virtual Choir on TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/eric_whitacre_a_virtual_choir_2_000_voices_strong.html). This video is fantastic! Conductor Eric Whitacre created a virtual choir with over 2,000 people. It shows how transformative the Internet is and the lengths that people will go to to connect with like-minded individuals.
 - [Google Reader](https://www.google.com/reader/). I have to give Reader props before it gets shut down. Google offered an amazing RSS reader that transformed the way I consumed the news. Before Google Plus, Reader allowed you to comment on stories--a social experience that no one has matched since. Let's hope I soon find another reader worth sharing.
